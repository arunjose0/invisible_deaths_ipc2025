## 📌 Conclusion

> 📈 **Progress with Persistent Gaps**  
India has made significant strides in improving the completeness of death registration, increasing from 70% in 2014 to 89.3% in 2021. However, this progress has been uneven—**gender disparities not only persist but have widened** over time.

### 🧩 Gender Effects and Shifting Mediators

Using state-level mediation models, we observed that in **2015**, asset ownership explained **15% of the gender gap** in registration. By **2020**, this contribution dropped to **just 3.1%**, indicating that **structural factors beyond wealth** are driving gender inequality in death registration.

### 🗺️ Spatial Inequality and Gender Bias

Regions already known for **low overall registration**, such as **Northern, Central, and Eastern India**, also show **the highest gender gaps**. This suggests that **geography and gender inequality intersect**, creating deep-rooted barriers to accurate mortality reporting.

::: {.callout-warning title="CRS Not Yet Fully Reliable"}
Despite improvements, CRS completeness remains **under 90%**, and cause-of-death information is often missing or unreliable. In some states, however, CRS has outperformed SRS, showing its future potential.
