## üß≠ About the Website

::: {style="text-align:justify"}

**Invisible Deaths** is a research communication website that shares findings from a study on **gender disparities in death registration in India**.

This site presents key insights from multiple national datasets (CRS, SRS, NFHS) and uses Bayesian modeling to explore:

- **Trends in death registration completeness**
- **District-level gender gaps**
- **The role of education, ownership, and other structural factors on death registration**

The content is designed for researchers, policymakers, and the public. Interactive maps, reproducible code, and visual summaries aim to make the data more accessible and the findings more actionable.
