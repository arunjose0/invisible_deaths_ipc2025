## 📈 Trends in Death Registration Completeness in India (2014–2021)

India has made strong progress in registering deaths over the last decade — but the gender gap has widened.


- **Overall completeness** rose from **70% in 2014** to **89.3% in 2021**.
- **Male deaths** were more likely to be registered:
  - From **73.4% (2014)** to **96% (2021)**
- **Female registration** also improved:
  - From **63.3% to 82.5%**
- However, the **gender gap widened**:
  - From **10.1% to 13.5%** over this period

## 🧭 Gender Gaps in Death Registration at the District Level (2021)

How wide is the gap in registering male and female deaths across India? NFHS-5 data show a consistent disadvantage for women, even after adjusting for household and socioeconomic characteristics.



### 📊 National Gender Gap

- In 2021, **India recorded a gender gap of 7.9 percentage points**  
  *(95% Credible Interval: 7.4 – 8.3)*  
- **Female deaths** were significantly less likely to be registered than male deaths.
- The model adjusted for:
  - Education
  - Religion
  - Wealth
  - Caste
  - Household and asset ownership

## 🧮 Total and Direct Effects of Gender on Death Registration (2015 & 2020)

This analysis uses **state-level data** from [NFHS-4 (2015–16)](https://rchiips.org/NFHS/nfhs-4Reports/India.pdf) and [NFHS-5 (2019–21)](https://rchiips.org/nfhs/factsheet_NFHS-5.shtml) to estimate the **total and direct effects of gender** on the completeness of death registration in **2015** and **2020**.  
Since **NFHS-4 did not include data on death registration**, we used **completeness estimates at the level of larger states**, derived from Civil Registration and SRS data (see [Objective 1](data_methods.html#how-we-estimated-completeness-of-death-registration-2014-2021-for-bigger-states)).

### 📊 Key Findings

- In **2015**, men were **8.62 percentage points** more likely to have their deaths registered than women  
  *(95% Credible Interval: 8.37 – 8.91)*  
- In **2020**, the gap narrowed slightly to **8.34 percentage points**  
  *(95% CI: 8.05 – 8.61)*

---

### 🔄 Mediation by Household Asset Ownership

We examined how much of the gender gap could be explained by **household ownership of land or housing** (a proxy for female material empowerment).

#### In 2015:
- **15.0%** of the gender gap was mediated through asset ownership  
- **Direct effect** of gender: **7.33 percentage points**  
  *(CI: 7.07 – 7.60)*

#### In 2020:
- **Only 3.12%** of the gap was mediated through ownership  
- **Direct effect** of gender: **8.08 percentage points**  
  *(CI: 7.79 – 8.36)*
